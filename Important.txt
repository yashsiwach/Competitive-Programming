1->compiler can perform 10^7 calculation in 1 sec!
2->To optmise the time of a solution in most of the cases we have to increase the sapace;
3->We use 0 based indexing in prefix sum because codeforce question works on position not index;
4->unique(begin,end)-removes the same elements present together like 1 1 2 2, change to 1,2,*,*;
5->handle the negitive mod -((a - b) % MOD + MOD) % MOD;
